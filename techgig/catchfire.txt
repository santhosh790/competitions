A Grass Field is divided into N x M Blocks of size 1. Some of the blocks in the field have caught fire. Now, in each
second, the fire is spreading to the adjacent Blocks i.e. if (i , j) Block is on fire at time t, then
Blocks (i + 1, j) , (i - 1, j) , (i , j - 1) , (i , j + 1) will be on fire at time t+1.

You will be provided with the current configuration of the field at time t = 0. Your task is to determine the minimum
time in which the whole field catches fire.
M[i][j] = 1 , if the block is on fire.
M[i][j] = 0 , if the block is not on fire.


Input Format
The First line will contain two Integers N and M denoting dimensions of the field.
Each of the next N lines will contain M integers.


Constraints
1 <= N,M <= 500
M[i][j] = {0,1}


Output Format
You have to print the Minimum Time in which the whole field catches fire.
If the complete field never catches fire, output -1.
